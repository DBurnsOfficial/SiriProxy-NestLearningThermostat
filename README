SiriProxy-NestLearningThermostat
================================
About:

Plugin for SiriProxy to communicate with the Nest.com servers to set thermostat temperature or get the status of the thermostat.
This plugin was adapter from SiriProxy-Thermostat plugin to call into nest.com.

Config:

Copy config-info.yml into ~/.siriproxy/config.yml and edit as appropriate. 

Caveats:

Currently only works with a single nest thermostat. I don't have multiple thermostats installed so it's hard to test, but should be relatively easy to adapt.

To Do:

* Caching of authentication token (currently logs into nest for each request)
* Caching of device information
